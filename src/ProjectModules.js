                  from the source domain dataset and unlabeled images from the target domain dataset.\
                  In the context of deep learning, the task is to learn features from the images of one \
                  domain and transfer learned representations to classify unlabeled target domain images. \
                  We implemented ADDA and ensemble strategies to enhance the adaptability and \
