                  communicate the range of prior probability and test cutoffs for which the model \
                  has positive utility; larger ApArs suggest a broader potential use of the model. \
                  Decision makers looking to adopt and implement models can\
                  leverage ApArs to assess if the local range of priors and utilities is within the respective ApArs.\
